         document.getElementById("modalContent").innerHTML= "1. Barbell Bench Press The barbell bench press is the most commonly known exercise. This is because it is effective and easy to learn. It also allows for the most weight to be pushed versus dumbbells because there is less stabilization involved and the tension can be focused straight to the pecs. Another great thing about it is that it is easy to spot, so you can push your limits when with a partner. Try a wider grip and closer grip to hit your chest in different ways.<br><br>2. Dumbbell Bench Press The dumbbell bench press is a great alternative to the barbell bench press. Usually you won’t be able to push as much weight, but you are able to work on your stabilizer muscles and have a wider range of motion. If you have strong stabilizer muscles in the chest, then you can control more weight. Having the wider range of motion can help work the muscle differently and give it a more complete look.<br><br>3. Incline Barbell Bench Press The incline barbell bench press is a great addition to any chest routine. This helps fill out the upper portion of the pectoralis major. When doing this, I advise that your angle is not too steep or else you will be working a lot of the front deltoids. With a slightly angled bench, you will feel tension on your upper chest. This can be done with a free barbell bench or with a smith machine. I personally prefer a smith machine for this, as it allows you to control the weight in one directed path.<br><br>4. Incline Dumbbell Bench Press Like the incline barbell bench press, this will target the pectoralis major. As with almost all dumbbell presses, your stabilizer muscles will be involved. This means slightly less weight, but a wider range of motion. Using an adjustable bench will allow you to change the angle in which you do your press. This is great because you can hit the chest in many different ways. Just be sure that it is not too steep or it will become more of a shoulder workout.<br><br>5. Decline Barbell Bench Press This one is more difficult to do unless you have proper equipment. You need a bench that declines and a smith machine. I don’t recommend free weight because it would be hard to control and difficult to get yourself in position to even do the workout (if you have a way then by all means do it). The decline bench is yet another way of hitting the chest, but from the bottom. It can give you a good scoop at the bottom of your chest if done properly. It can be hard to hit that part of your chest with other workouts which is why I love doing this.<br><br>6. Pec Deck Machine This a great overall chest workout. It is great for beginner and experienced lifters. It not only delivers a great pump to the chest, but it is balanced, controlled, and makes sure that you are going in the right direction. A dumbbell fly is great, but can be easily done with the wrong form. The machine ensures that you are doing it correctly and it puts a lot of tension on the chest.<br><br>7. Deep Dips are a great way to incorporate a body weight exercise into the routine. These are one of the few workouts that will work the lower portion of the chest. To make sure you hit the chest, make sure your feet are behind you, you have a wide grip with elbows flaring out, and you are leaning forward as much as possible. This ensures that you aren’t doing a tricep dip. Pair it with pushups for a great body weight chest workout.<br><br>8. Machine Chest Press This will work on the chest the same way as a regular bench press would. The difference is that it is more controlled which is great, especially for beginners. The control aspect of it can also benefit you by allowing a slow and controlled set. Also, since the machine forces a certain motion, it will concentrate more directly on the pecs while involving less shoulders than a free weight press would.";

	        "Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand. Keep your elbows close to your body and rotate the palms of your hands until they are facing forward. This will be your starting position. Now you will curl the dumbbell up until you reach shoulder level.  This is a very basic and standard bicep exercise that is very effective. There are a lot of different variations you can do with this exercise; but nothing beats the ole standing bicep curl." +
          "<br><br><b>Standing Barbell Curl:</b><br>While holding the barbell, your starting position is the exact same as the standing dumbbell curl stance. Stand up straight with the barbell in your hands at arms-length. Keep your elbows close to your body and make sure your palms are facing forward. Start the curl to your body and end when you reach shoulder level. Once again, there are many different variations of this exercise but those will be covered in a separate article coming soon." +
          "<br><br><b>Seated dumbbell curl:</b><br>Your starting position is on an adjustable bench that is about a notch or two below the top 90-degree angle. With a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing forward begin to curl until you reach shoulder level. I prefer to do the notch or two below to really feel the bicep contraction from start to finish in each repetition."
          "<br><br><b>Standing Bicep Cable Curl:</b><br>Stand upright with the pulley at the lowest level possible, with the bar by your thighs, and your palms facing forward. Begin to curl and contract your biceps until the bar reaches shoulder level. You can use different bars and grips to hit the biceps in different ways for optimal gains. While your training certain body parts, sometimes the body starts to hurt. With this exercise if your wrists start to hurt you can easily swap out a different bar for the curls, the simple switch can really help relieve a lot of wrist pain."
          "<br><br><b>Standing Hammer Curl:</b><br>Start with the dumbbells in your hands with your palms facing towards your body. As you start to contract your biceps keep the stationary hold until the top of the dumbbell reaches your shoulder level. This is one of the alternative forms of standing bicep curls to help hit the bicep in different ways."
          "<br><br><b>Machine Bicep Curls:</b><br>While free weights like dumbbells and barbells are effective to hit some of the major stabilizer muscles around the bicep; it is also nice to finish a bicep workout with isolated bicep work when your stabilizers are weak. Your starting position is seated with your arms extended grasping the bar and or handles to commence the bicep curl. Contract all the way up to shoulder level and back down."

         "Proper Overhead Press form starts standing with the bar on your front shoulders and deltoids. Press the bar over your head until your elbows are locked. Don’t use your legs, keep them straight. The Overhead Press is a full body, compound exercise. Your shoulders and arms press the weight over your head while your legs, lower back and abs balance you, (works your whole core for stabilization). The Overhead Press is one of the best exercises to build strong, muscular, and healthy shoulders." +
         "<br><br><b>Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press:</b><br>We listed this work out specifically to “seated” dumbbell shoulder press for the sole reason that you can focus on building the shoulders up while not worrying about core and back support; that’s what the ninety-degree seat is for. Some people start with the dumbbells on their knees and kick the weight up onto your shoulders one at a time. While others put the dumbbells on the ground and power clean them onto your shoulders. Once the weight is up you then press straight into the air until your arms lock. After the lockout you decline the weight back down to a ninety-degree elbow position and repeat."+
         "<br><br><b>Dumbbell Lateral Raise:</b><br>For the side lateral raise, grasp dumbbells in front of your thighs with your elbows slightly bent. Bend over slightly with the hips and knees bent slightly for increased stability. Go for form more than heavy weight. After the preparation is done proceed to raise your arms while maintaining slightly bent elbows. You only need to go up to ninety-degrees to obtain full range of motion. Then proceed to decline the weight to starting position, you want slow controlled movements for proper form and increased muscle gains." +
         "<br><br><b>Straight Arm Shoulder Extensions:</b><br>The straight arm shoulder extensions are a great way to target your front deltoids on your shoulder workout. Start with the dumbbells on your front thighs with your palms facing down and bring your arm straight up until your arm is at a ninety-degree angle. You can either choose to do both arms at once or to do single arm raises. Whichever you may choose to perform remember to maintain slow and controlled movement to maintain proper form.";
