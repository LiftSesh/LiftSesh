    <h2>All You Need Is 60 Days</h2>
    <p>When you go to your favorite restaurant, I’m going to take a guess and say that you usually order the same thing or two every time you go. That item tastes great, so why switch it up? People are creatures of habit, but if you can break certain habits and try new things, maybe you will find something you like better. The same thing goes for lifestyle choices. I want to help you break your negative lifestyle choices and incorporate a healthy and active way of life into your daily habits. Once something is a habit you no longer feel the stress of trying to make time for it. It just becomes a natural part of your weekly routine. The idea is that all you need is 60 days for something to become a habit.
	You can use almost anything for an example, but for simplicity purposes I will use reading a book. Step 1: find the thing in your life that you want to become a habit (reading). Step 2: Set realistic goals for your 60-day period. (I will read a book for 30minites 4 times a week). Step 3: track your results; write down when you read your book and for how long. This way you create a log over time and can physically see your progress (I read on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday 30 minutes each time). Step 4: Execute the plan for the next 60 days and watch that activity become your new habit and hobby. I guarantee that even half way through you will see progress and will want to increase the amount of anything you wanted to accomplish. You might even bump up the reading to an hour at a time.
	Here is my story. I tried many years to get myself to go to the gym consistently only to fail each time. That is, until I found out about this 60 days thing. I did some research and found that after 60 days, things become a habit. So I put my knowledge to the test and it worked! Here is how I started making working out a habit with my 4 step process.
I decided to make working out my habit, step 1 finished. After that I came up with a simple weekly schedule for when I can go to the gym. I worked part time with no set schedule so I would go when I could fit in the time. I made it a goal to attend the gym 4 times a week. I only went for maybe an hour at a single time, but I put forth the effort and committed myself to my goals, step 2 complete. I immediately started logging when I could go to the gym and for how long I attended, step 3 complete. After the first 2 weeks it became a lot easier. I was able to make time to attend the gym with ease. I got into a set workout routine, and my muscle soreness started to decrease after every workout. After the first month was complete, I could tell there were already differences that were visible in the mirror and on the weight scale, Step 4 complete. After seeing the results, I got even more invigorated and began to add another day into my routine. When the 60 days were over I realized that not only did working out become a habit, it was also now my most beloved hobby.
